         <h3>Our mother Lokam</h3>
         <p>
            Lokampikai Ammah, affectionately called Lokam, was born in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia in 1936 for immigrant parents. She was the second child of four children to our grandparents. She had an older brother (late Somasundaram), younger sister Sushila, and younger brother Bala. Due to imminent WW2, most of the family, including my mother and grandmother went back to Ceylon to the safer shores, when she was only 3. She spent most of her childhood growing up in Urumpirai Jaffna spending precious time with her grandparents. She often told us although times were tough during the war she had such a peaceful life at her maternal grandparents, who farmed. Little Lokam enjoyed scurrying water, tea and meals to them at the fields.
         </p>
         <p>
            From 1940 until the end of the twentieth century Lokam spent her life in Ceylon that in between changed its name to Sri Lanka. She studied at the Urumpirai Hindu College and finished her school certificate at the Hindu Ladies College, Jaffana. At home, she helped her ailing mother and looked after the household while father was still working in Malaya. She was studious and hard working, and was keen to pursue her education further. However, family circumstances and traditions meant she could not continue with her education &ndash; she often told us that she wanted to become a teacher. Nonetheless, she got married to my late father Shanmuganathan in 1957, which opened another chapter in Lokam's life.
         </p>
         <p>
            Lokam gave birth to three daughters &ndash; Subana, Manchuna and Sulojana. She took great care in our upbringing and made sure our education took priority. She was not just a mother, but a pillar of strength, support, and a great teacher for her children to see life as it is. When my father got transferred to various cities and towns of Sri Lanka as part of the government employment agreement, my mother pretty much single-handedly raised us in Urumpirai. She never reprimanded us, believing that children should be loved and cared, not beaten up to make a point.
         </p>
         <p>
            After seeing us children moving overseas &ndash; two of us emigrated to New Zealand and the other to Canada &ndash; our parents made the inevitable decision to reluctantly emigrate from Sri Lanka. In 1999, both my mother and father arrived in New Zealand. Although initially it was touch difficult to be away from their folks back home, they settled in quite well. My mother made New Zealand home for the past twenty years, just about a quarter of her life. They both became citizens of New Zealand in 2003, which was a very proud moment for them. They were both initially British citizens, later took Sri Lankan citizenship when they were married, and later became the citizens of this beautiful country.
         </p>
         <p>
            While Lokam struggled with a fair share of things in life as we all do, seeing our father passing away in 2007 was not easy for her. Just a month after their golden wedding anniversary, our father (known as Shan) departed this world. It turned her life upside down, literally. Initially, she struggled but her tenacity and strength saw her through the difficult times to chart her own path.
         </p>
         <p>
            We are deeply grateful for our mother, for the love, care, and continuous support she showered us throughout our lives. As many would know, our lives were shaped by Mum. She displayed and infused joy and kindness in all who came in touch with her. She gave her time and energy to help the less privileged in the community. She held the office of treasurer for the local seniors' club called Sakthi Seniors between 2011 and 2014.
         </p>
         <p>
            Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with dementia in 2016, which brought a lot of difficulties including limited mobility. By 2018, she completely lost the ability to walk by herself and become bedbound. Her health progressively but rapidly deteriorated, with a few bouts of infections intermittently.
         </p>
         <p>
            Mother, we want to say thank you for your generosity with everything you gave us. Your gentle guidance, kindness, and above all the unconditional love you showered all of us cannot be repaid. We now let you continue your journey home to the pure lands, and pray for safe passage.
         </p>

         <h3>My Dearest Akka</h3>
         <p>
            Years have gone past since we met last and it's been months since we spoke. The distance, time zones and your failing health have made it difficult for us to be as close as we wished to be.
         </p>
         <p>
            I have now been told that you are no more and that you have transcended into eternity. I'm sad and heartbroken, very very much, much more than I could ever express, to realize that it will not be possible ever to be with you or speak with you.
         </p>
         <p>
            Yet, memories of our time together, as children of our parents, as sisters amongst our siblings and as friends, are fresh in my mind.  I shall hold those memories sacred and close to my heart. They shall give me comfort from a special corner of my heart.
         </p>
         <p>
            I'm glad that you are finally free from the pain that you have felt for sometime and for that I'm thankful.  Farwell, my one and only sister, I'm sure we will be together, someday, somewhere and somehow.
         </p>
         <p>
            I will continue to see and hear you in your daughters until its time for me too, to leave this worldly abode. May God's blessings be with you always.
